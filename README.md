SELECTIVE STRUCTURES:

REPETIVE STRUCTURES:

NESTED STRUCTURES:

TYPES OF ALGORITHM REPRESENTATION:
-GRAPH.
-FLOWCHART.
-WRITTEN:PSEUDOCODE.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS:
Constants do not change in value over time. Constants can be any type of number. 
Variables are usually visualized as letters or a phrase, and in certain cases variables can have more than one possible value. Most often variables are used to indicate that a number in an equation or expression is not yet known.

DISTINGUISH THE TYPES OF COMPUTACIONAL DATA:
-NUMERIC. Quantities that can be used to make operations.
-LOGIC. Decisions to make between possible answers using equal, and, or less than, greater than 
-STRING AND CHARACTERS. Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.
-ARRANGEMENTS. It is a set of data or a homogeneous data structure that is located consecutively. 

TYPES OF COMPUTACIONAL OPERATIONS:
  ->OPERATORS:
-ARITHMETIC. That perform arithmetic operations with numeric operands. 
-LOGIC. Which perform logical operations with bool operands. 
-RELATIONSHIPS. That compare numeric operands. 
  ->OPERANDS:
-VARIABLES. Used in operations, its value can change. a, b
-CONSTANTS. Used in operations, its value cannot change. x, y
  ->EXPRESSIONS:
-ARITHMETIC. Integers or float, real numbers.
-LOGIC. True or False decisions.
